# CEI Stakeholder Meeting Questions

**Meeting Purpose:** Validate requirements and gather specific implementation details for College of Eastern Idaho pilot  
**Contacts:** Dr. Leslie Jernberg (Assessment Champion), Dean Matthew R. Taylor  
**Governing Body:** NWCCU (Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities)

**Our Understanding:** Based on your video and spreadsheet analysis, we understand you have:
- 1,543 CLO records across 173 courses in your current Access database
- S/U assessment workflow with 75% pass threshold
- Multi-user concurrency issues causing data corruption
- Narrative workflow (celebrations, challenges, changes) for each CLO

## Top Priority Questions (13 Total)

### **1. NWCCU Requirements & Hierarchy**
1. **Complete Reporting Structure:** How do CLOs roll up to Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) and then to Institutional Learning Outcomes (ILOs) for NWCCU submissions?

1.5. Do you foresee a need for any roles other than instructor and administrator?


2. **Required Reports List:** Can you provide the complete list of reports you submit to NWCCU each year? We want to ensure our system generates exactly what you need.

3. **Report Formats:** Do NWCCU submissions need to be PDF, Word, Excel, or other specific formats?

### **2. Data Validation & Formats**What's the complete list of grade formats we need to support? (pass/fail,Letter grades, numbers, withdrawal codes, etc.)

5. **Assessment Method Detail:** Are your current assessment tool descriptions (like those in your spreadsheet) sufficient for NWCCU requirements?

6. **S/U Threshold Validation:** Is 75% the standard pass threshold for all programs, or does this vary by program or CLO?

### **3. Current System Pain Points**
7. **Faculty Form Experience:** What specific problems do faculty have with the current Access forms that we should solve?

### **4. Workflow & Process**
8. **Data Entry Responsibility:** Who typically enters CLO data - instructors themselves or administrative staff?

9. **Timeline Pressure:** When are NWCCU reports due and how long does compilation currently take?

### **5. System Integration & Migration**
10. **Access Export Value:** Would the ability to export our web data to Access format help during evaluation and transition?

11. **Parallel Operation:** Could you run both systems simultaneously during evaluation to build confidence?

### **6. User Experience & Data Views**
12. **Faculty Dashboard Needs:** What data do instructors need to see about their own courses? For example:
    - Just their own course data vs. comparative program data
    - CLO completion status and deadlines
    - Historical performance trends
    - Different permissions than program administrators?

13. **Administrative Views:** What cross-course data do you need for program management and NWCCU preparation?

## Meeting Strategy Notes

### **Lead with Understanding:**
- Reference specific CEI data (1,543 CLO records, Abby's ACC-201 course with 3 CLOs)
- Acknowledge their Access system investment and expertise
- Show we understand the CLO-centric assessment model and S/U workflow

### **Focus on Views, Not Reports:**
- Ask what data views they need rather than assuming report formats
- Understand the complete hierarchy above CLOs (PLO → ILO?)
- Design live dashboards with export capabilities
- Avoid building static reports - keep data live with export options

### **Emphasize Collaboration:**
- Bridge strategy reduces risk and respects their current investment
- Access export maintains existing workflow during evaluation
- Parallel operation allows gradual adoption
- Technical solutions without marketing pressure

### **Key Validation Points:**
- Confirm CLO → PLO → ILO hierarchy structure
- Validate S/U threshold and narrative workflow requirements  
- Understand NWCCU submission requirements and formats
- Confirm value of Access export for migration strategy
