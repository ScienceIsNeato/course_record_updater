feat: demo prep with full faculty invite and CLO workflow

Complete demo functionality for Leslie with improved ship_it coverage reporting.

**Features:**
- Faculty invitation modal with cascading course/section assignment
- CLO assessment progress tracking and reminder emails
- Role preservation during imports (don't downgrade admins)
- Course offering, term, and CLO import via CEI adapter
- Enhanced dashboard panels for terms, offerings, CLO audit
- ship_it coverage check now clearly distinguishes test failures from coverage gaps

**Test Coverage: 79.62%** (target 80%, working toward it)
- Added 27 new unit tests (+4 email reminder tests, +16 app error path tests, +3 password reset tests, +5 reminder_login tests)
- app.py improved from 72.32% to 85.71%
- email_service.py improved to 93.47%
- Remaining gap due to substantial new untested code:
  * inviteFaculty.js: 274 new lines (needs dedicated JS test file)
  * import_service internal methods: 200+ new lines
  * institution_dashboard.js: +286 lines new rendering code
  * Total: +3234 lines across 42 files for complete demo workflow

This commit enables the full Leslie demo: invite → import → assess → remind → audit.
The ship_it fix eliminates confusion about coverage vs test failures.
