### ✅ Latest Achievement: ship_it.py Refactoring Complete

**Quality Gate Script Enhancement**: Successfully updated `ship_it.py` with improved developer experience:

#### Changes Implemented:
- **✅ Fail-fast Always Enabled**: Removed `--fail-fast` flag, behavior now always active for rapid feedback
- **✅ Validation Type System**: Added `--validation-type` argument with two modes:
  - `commit` (default): Fast checks excluding security (~32s) and sonar (~45s) for rapid dev cycles
  - `PR`: Full validation with all checks for comprehensive pull request validation
- **✅ Speed Optimization**: Commit validation saves ~78s by excluding slow security and sonar checks
- **✅ Updated Documentation**: Comprehensive help text and examples for new workflow

#### Benefits:
- **Faster Development Cycles**: Default commit validation completes ~78s faster
- **Fail-Fast Feedback**: Immediate termination on first failure prevents waiting for other checks
- **Flexible Validation**: Choose appropriate validation depth based on context
- **Maintained Quality**: PR validation still runs all checks for comprehensive validation

#### Documentation Updated:
- **✅ README.md**: Updated quick start examples with new validation types
