# CLO Audit System - User Feedback Survey

1. **Permissions**: Any issues with role capabilities or access controls?
2. **Audit Workflow**: Is the review/approval process intuitive and efficient?
3. **Section-Level Granularity**: Do you need CLO status per section, or would course-level be simpler?
4. **Branding**: Would custom colors/logos matching your institution increase adoption?
5. **Performance**: Any delays, errors, or mobile access issues?
6. **Import/Export**: How was data import? Need export for reporting?
7. **Features**: What's working well? What's missing or frustrating?
8. **Additional**: Any other features or improvements you'd like to see?
9. currently, CLOs are all being managed one by one for each section. Would it be more likely that they would be preocessed as a batch, all having the same results? Is that flow common enough that batch processing should be implemented? If so, which levels would you want to be able to batch by - instructor? course? course offering (ie biology 101 spring 25) or even course offering section ()
10. Do we need to be able to track the exams/syllabai/etc for each... CLO? section? course? what all would be nice to be able to specify and manage onthe site?
11. Currenlty Admins do not receive notifications via email when instructors submit assessments. Is this something that should be implemented, or would that just be noise?
    **Rate 1-10**: Overall system satisfaction

Known Issues for Demo:

- Some small issues around changing/creating passowrds - figured not needed for demo
- I currently don't have a flow for approving the course-level audit data, like celebrations and so on. I wanted to get feedback first about the current flow and if you wnated to stick with per outcome level management like shown here, or just always treat things as a batch per section/offering
