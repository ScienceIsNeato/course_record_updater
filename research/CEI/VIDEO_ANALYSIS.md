# CEI Video Analysis - Leslie's Current System

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Insights from Leslie's Walkthrough

### Current System Architecture
- **Database:** Microsoft Access ("held together with bubble gum and duct tape")
- **Major Pain Points:** Row locking issues with multiple users
- **Data Export:** Currently generates spreadsheet feeds from Access DB
- **Form Interface:** Functional but admits "I can't build forms" - UX is poor

### Critical Technical Problems
1. **Multi-user Issues:** "Multiple people on database typing and things go into random rows"
2. **Data Integrity:** Records don't attach to correct classes
3. **Scalability:** Access DB hitting limits with concurrent users
4. **User Experience:** Forms are functional but not user-friendly

## ðŸ“Š Data Structure Revealed

### Course-Level Data (One Course = Multiple CLO Records)
- **Course + Instructor** (combo field in Access)
- **Students Enrolled** (total number)
- **Student Outcomes:**
  - Students who passed
  - Students who got D/C/Incomplete  
  - Students who withdrew (W)
  - Math validation: Enrolled - Withdrawn - Passed - D/C/I = 0

### CLO (Course Learning Outcome) Level Data
Each course has **multiple CLOs** (one-to-many relationship):
- **Assessment Tool** (specific to each CLO)
- **Students who took assessment** 
- **Students who passed assessment**
- **Pass Rate Calculation** (passed Ã· took)
- **Result:** S (Satisfactory) or U (Unsatisfactory) based on 75% threshold
- **Narrative Text** (qualitative assessment)

### Example from Video:
**Abby's Course:**
- 14 students enrolled
- 1 student withdrew
- 11 students passed
- 2 students D/C/Incomplete
- **CLO Example:** 9/13 students passed = 69% = "U" (below 75% threshold)

## ðŸŽ¯ Perfect Validation of Our Approach

### What We Got Right âœ…
- **Multi-instructor support** - Confirmed need
- **Course-instance model** - Matches their one course = multiple CLO records
- **Grade distribution tracking** - They track pass/fail/withdraw
- **Assessment data** - They need detailed outcome tracking
- **Narrative fields** - Qualitative assessment text required

### What We Need to Add/Adjust ðŸ”„
- **CLO (Course Learning Outcome) entity** - This is the key missing piece!
- **Assessment tools tracking** - Each CLO has specific assessment method
- **75% pass threshold** - Automatic S/U calculation
- **Data validation** - Math reconciliation checks
- **Bulk data import** - Need to migrate from Access DB

## ðŸš€ Our Value Proposition is Perfect

### Problems We Solve:
1. **Multi-user concurrency** - Web app eliminates row locking
2. **Data integrity** - Proper relational DB with constraints
3. **User experience** - Modern web forms vs. Access forms
4. **Scalability** - Cloud-based, no Access limitations
5. **Data migration** - Can import their existing Access data

### Migration Strategy:
- **Option 1:** Direct Access DB export â†’ Firestore import
- **Option 2:** Use existing spreadsheet as data source
- **Benefit:** Preserve all historical data while modernizing system

## ðŸ“‹ Updated Data Model Requirements

### New Entity: CourseOutcome (CLO)
```
CourseOutcome:
- course_id (foreign key)
- outcome_description
- assessment_tool
- students_took_assessment
- students_passed_assessment  
- pass_rate (calculated)
- threshold_percentage (default 75%)
- result (S/U based on threshold)
- narrative_text
```

### Enhanced Course Entity:
```
Course:
- students_enrolled
- students_passed_course
- students_dc_incomplete
- students_withdrew
- validation_reconciled (boolean)
- course_pass_rate (calculated)
```

## ðŸ’¡ Meeting Talking Points

### Technical Advantages:
- "Web-based solution eliminates Access concurrency issues"
- "Modern database handles multiple users seamlessly"
- "No more 'bubble gum and duct tape' - proper architecture"
- "Can import all your existing Access data"

### User Experience Benefits:
- "Better forms than Access - designed for faculty ease of use"
- "Automatic calculations - no manual math reconciliation"
- "Real-time collaboration without data corruption"
- "Mobile-friendly for faculty convenience"

### Business Value:
- "Eliminate data integrity issues"
- "Reduce time spent on manual processes"  
- "Scale beyond Access limitations"
- "Professional reporting and analytics"
