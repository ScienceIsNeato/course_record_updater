# **Project Plan – Learning Outcomes AsSaaSment**  
**Pilot: College of Eastern Idaho (CEI) – NWCCU Accreditation**

---

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the phased plan for developing a lightweight SaaS tool to help departments at U.S. community colleges track and report **student learning outcomes (SLOs)** for accreditation. The first pilot will be with **CEI’s Biology Department**, aligned to **NWCCU** standards.  

---

## 2. Objectives
- Replace error-prone spreadsheets with a simple, department-level web tool.  
- Enable **self-service adoption** without requiring institution-wide IT buy-in.  
- Provide **low-cost, per-course pricing** that undercuts enterprise competitors.  
- Build the product with a modular **adapter system** to scale across accrediting regions.  

---

## 3. Stakeholders
- **Pilot Institution:** College of Eastern Idaho  
- **Primary Accreditor:** NWCCU  
- **Primary Users:** Department Deans (Biology initially), faculty contributors  
- **Secondary Users:** Institutional Research staff, admins compiling accreditation reports  

---

## 4. Execution Plan (Phased)

### **Phase 1 – Requirements Validation (CEI/NWCCU)**
- Meet with CEI Biology leadership (Matt + boss).  
- Validate assumptions: required data fields, report format, cadence, workflow.  
- Collect sample NWCCU reports/templates.  
- Deliverables:  
  - Confirmed data model  
  - Example report to model Report Builder  
  - Success criteria for pilot (e.g., Fall 2025 report <30 minutes, <5% error)  

### **Phase 2 – MVP Build (Pilot Only)**
- Core workflows:  
  - Manual entry form (course + outcomes data)  
  - File upload + adapter parsing (initially just NWCCU/CEI style)  
  - Ledger view (sortable/searchable)  
  - Report Builder (Word/PDF export modeled on CEI submission format)  
- Costs:  
  - Cloud hosting (Cloud Run/Firestore): $25–50/month  
  - Domain & SSL: ~$20/year  
  - Development: sweat equity  
  - One-time adapter development: ~20–40 hrs  

### **Phase 3 – Pilot Test & Feedback**
- Biology department at CEI runs one cycle using the tool.  
- Feedback collected from faculty, admins, and dean.  
- Iterations: UI polish, adapter tweaks, export refinements.  

### **Phase 4 – Regional Expansion (NWCCU colleges)**
- Build **NWCCU adapter v2** generalized for multiple departments/institutions.  
- Market to other NWCCU-accredited community colleges (150+ potential).  
- Pricing: $8.99/course/month with first course free trial.  

### **Phase 5 – Multi-Region Expansion**
- Add new adapters for other accreditors:  
  - HLC (Midwest, largest accreditor)  
  - SACSCOC (South)  
  - ACCJC (California)  
- Each accreditor requires:  
  - Data model alignment  
  - Export template/report builder customization

## 5. User Stories

### **Data Entry**
- As a faculty member, I can manually add a course and outcomes so they’re stored centrally.  
- As a dean, I can upload existing Word/Excel reports and let the adapter parse them.  
- As a dean, I can duplicate a course from a past term so I don’t have to re-enter static details.  
- As a user, I can edit a course inline in the ledger table for quick fixes.  
- As a user, I can delete a course if it was added in error.  

### **Maintenance**
- As a department, I can archive past reports by term.  
- As a dean, I can update outcomes/courses without breaking historical records.  
- As an admin, I can view all historical versions of a course for audit purposes.  
- As a user, I can attach supporting documents (rubrics, syllabi) to courses for future reference.  

### **Reporting**
- As a dean, I can generate a report in the NWCCU template format.  
- As a college, I can export past cycles to demonstrate longitudinal improvement.  
- As a dean, I can download the report in both Word (editable) and PDF (submission-ready).  
- As a user, I can filter reports by aim, course, or term for custom slices.  
- As a department, I can generate a summary view that highlights gaps (courses without aims mapped).  

### **Quality Assurance**
- As a dean, I can run a pre-submission “validation check” to catch missing or invalid data before exporting.  
- As an admin, I can lock a report once submitted, ensuring integrity of past submissions.  

### **Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)**
- As an institution, I can grant multiple users access with role-based permissions.  
- As a faculty member, I can enter assessment results directly (scores/percentages).  
- As an admin, I can auto-import data from LMS exports with minimal formatting changes.

## 6. Validation Meeting Agenda (CEI Pilot)

**A. Current Workflow**  
- How is the NWCCU report currently produced?  
- Which tools (Excel, Word, LMS) are in use?  

**B. Data Requirements**  
- Required metrics? (grades, pass rates, student outcome attainment)  
- Targets/benchmarks needed?  
- Rubrics or only grades?  

**C. Reporting**  
- File format NWCCU expects (Word/PDF)?  
- Standard templates?  
- Cadence (annual, mid-cycle, year-7)?  

**D. Roles & Permissions**  
- Who enters data?  
- Who approves/signs off?  

**E. Maintenance**  
- How often do courses/outcomes change?  
- Should past reports be versioned?  

**F. Automation**  
- Value of spreadsheet adapters?  
- Manual entry acceptable?

## 8. Revenue Potential (Back-of-Envelope)

**Assumptions:** $8.99/course/month, 1 account per institution.  
- Small dept (~10 courses): $899/year

- Large dept (~50 courses): $5,394/year  

**Regional penetration (NWCCU, ~150 CCs):**  
- 10% adoption (15 schools, avg 25 courses): ~$40K ARR  
- 25% adoption (38 schools, avg 25 courses): ~$101K ARR  
- 50% adoption (75 schools, avg 25 courses): ~$202K ARR
