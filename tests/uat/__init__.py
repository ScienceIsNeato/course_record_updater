"""
UAT (User Acceptance Testing) Test Suite

This package contains comprehensive user acceptance tests that validate
end-to-end workflows from a user's perspective, focusing on:

- Role-based data access and isolation
- Multi-institution data integrity
- Dashboard visibility across user roles
- Export functionality and data completeness
- Cross-tenant security boundaries

These tests use rich, realistic test data and validate both UI state
(dashboard panels) and exported data (CSV exports).
