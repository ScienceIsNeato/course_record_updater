9.  **[X] Dummy File Adapter (`dummy_adapter.py`)**
    *   [X] Re-create/Verify `adapters/dummy_adapter.py`.
    *   [X] Ensure it has the `parse(document)` function.
    *   [X] Returns a dictionary matching expected fields (strings for validation).

10. **[X] Integrate Automatic Flow (/add_course_automatic)**
    *   [X] Rename `/upload` route to `/add_course_automatic`.
    *   [X] Update the route handler to use `FileAdapterDispatcher` and `database_service`.
    *   [X] Update `index.html` file upload form action.
    *   [X] Added sample adapters (`NursingSampleAdapter`, `BusinessSampleAdapter`) and generation script.
    *   [X] Implemented duplicate checking and improved upload result feedback.
11. **[X] UI - Edit/Delete Functionality**

## Current Status: CEI Stakeholder Analysis Complete ✅

**Objective Complete:** Comprehensive analysis of real stakeholder data and requirements validation.

**Major Discoveries:**
*   **CLO-Centric System:** 1,543 Course Learning Outcome records across 173 courses
*   **Access Database Pain Points:** Multi-user concurrency issues, poor form UX
*   **Bridge Strategy:** Export to Access format for parallel operation during evaluation
*   **Complete Data Structure:** Real schema from CEI's current system

**Research Materials:**
*   **Video Analysis:** Leslie's 5-minute walkthrough of current Access system
*   **Spreadsheet Analysis:** 1,543 CLO records with complete field mapping
*   **Stakeholder Contacts:** Dr. Leslie Jernberg (Assessment Champion) & Dean Matthew Taylor
*   **Technical Requirements:** CLO assessment workflow, S/U thresholds, narrative fields

**Updated Documentation:**
*   **Data Model:** Added CourseOutcome (CLO) entity as primary assessment unit
*   **Stakeholder Questions:** 60 targeted questions including 20 CEI-specific
*   **Bridge Strategy:** Access export integration for risk-free migration
*   **Pricing Strategy:** Technical focus, Access export included

**Next Steps:** Stakeholder meeting to validate hierarchy above CLOs and reporting requirements.

## Current Focus: Milestone 13 - Deployment Setup (Google Cloud Run)

**Objective:** Prepare the application for deployment on Google Cloud Run to allow client access and feedback.

**Tasks:**
*   Create `Dockerfile`.
*   Create `.gcloudignore` file.
*   Configure `gunicorn` for production serving.
*   Guide user through `gcloud run deploy` command.

**Testing Note:** Ensure Firestore credentials/service account setup is handled correctly for the Cloud Run environment.
