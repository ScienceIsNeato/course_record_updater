## Questions for Discussion

1. **Department Structure:** Do you need department-level administration, or is institution-level sufficient?

2. **Data Visibility:** Should regular users see courses from:
   - Only their own courses?
   - Their entire department?
   - The entire institution?

3. **Course Ownership:** Who can edit a course?
   - Only the person who created it?
   - Anyone in the same department?
   - Anyone the admin grants access to?

4. **Historical Data:** Should users be able to:
   - Edit courses from previous semesters?
   - Only view historical data?
   - Archive old courses?

5. **Bulk Operations:** Which roles need the ability to:
   - Import multiple courses at once?
   - Delete multiple courses?
   - Duplicate courses across semesters?

6. **Approval Workflows:** Do you need:
   - Approval before courses are "published"?
   - Review process for reports before submission?
   - Change approval for sensitive data?
