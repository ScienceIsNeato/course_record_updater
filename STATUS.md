# Course Record Updater - Current Status

## Latest Work: PR #39 Fixes (2026-01-02)

**Status**: ⏳ WAITING FOR CI - Fixed most issues (smoke tests passing, working on e2e)

### Completed
- ✅ Fixed script paths in maintAInability-gate.sh (run_uat.sh, check_frontend.sh)
- ✅ Fixed audit_clo.js conflicting styling and DOM element usage
- ✅ Fixed coverage XML path in GitHub workflow (build/coverage.xml)
- ✅ Removed duplicate import and stray text
- ✅ Reduced complexity in 5 functions (all now <15)
- ✅ Coverage improved to 84% (exceeds 80% threshold)
- ✅ Fixed restart_server.sh to use `python -m src.app` (handles relative imports)
- ✅ Fixed run_uat.sh seed_db.py path
- ✅ Added PYTHONPATH fixes to seed_db.py for direct execution
- ✅ Fixed CI workflows to use `python -m src.app` (smoke & integration tests)
- ✅ Fixed test_profile_api.py CSRF validation issues (added WTF_CSRF_ENABLED=False)
- ✅ Verified all critical scripts work correctly locally
- ✅ Verified demo workflow (seed + advance) works

### Scripts Verified
- restart_server.sh ✅ (server starts successfully)
- check_frontend.sh ✅ (all checks pass)
- seed_db.py ✅ (demo seeding works)
- advance_demo.py ✅ (works correctly)
- ship_it.py ✅ (used throughout testing)

### Pushed to CI
8 commits total - waiting for CI validation.

## Previous Work: Repository Reorganization (2026-01-01)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Refactor & Quality Gate Passed

### What We Did

Complete repository reorganization to move all source code into `src/` directory and organize supporting files into logical locations. Addressed hundreds of import issues and test failures.

### Changes Made

1. **Moved 31 Source Files** → `src/`
   - Core: `app.py`, `api_routes.py`, `import_cli.py`
   - Utils: `constants.py`, `logging_config.py`, `term_utils.py`
   - Models: `models.py`, `models_sql.py`
   - Database: 6 files
   - Services: 13 files
   - Packages: `api/`, `adapters/`, `email_providers/`, `bulk_email_models/`

2. **Moved Configuration** → `config/`
   - `.coveragerc`, `.eslintrc.js`, `pytest.ini`, `sonar-project.properties`, etc.

3. **Moved Data & Demos**
   - `data/`: Database files and session data
   - `tests/data/`: Test data (consolidated)
   - `demos/`: Consolidated `demo_data` and `demo_artifacts`
   - `archive/`: Consolidated `ARCHIVED` and `archives`

4. **Moved Build Artifacts** → `build/`
   - Coverage reports, test results, security scans

5. **Moved Scripts** → `scripts/`
   - Shell scripts (`restart_server.sh`, `run_uat.sh`, etc.)

### Refactoring Phase 3: Final Consolidation & Quality Gates ✅
- [x] Update documentation (README.md, structure diagrams)
- [x] Update CI/CD configurations (Dockerfile, Jest, SonarCloud)
- [x] Correct stale path references in all scripts
- [x] Refactor frontend security hotspots (Appease Semgrep vs. Suppress)
  - [x] Refactored `audit_clo.js`, dashboards, and `panels.js` to use DOM API construction
  - [x] Optimized `ship_it.py` fail-fast mechanism (True non-blocking shutdown)
  - [x] Enabled frontend auto-fixes in `maintAInability-gate.sh`
- [x] Final Quality Gate validation pass

### Current State:
- Repositories reorganized into `src/` structure.
- Imports correctly migrated to `src.*` namespaced paths.
- All quality gates (linting, typing, coverage, security) passing.
- Frontend code refactored for XSS prevention without suppression.
- Fail-fast mechanism in `ship_it.py` is now highly efficient.

### Next Steps:
1. Final verification commit.

### Latest Work: Security & Test Optimization (2026-01-02)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Parallelized & Categorized

### Changes
- ✅ **Parallelized Security Checks**: Reduced security audit time from ~60s to ~17s in commit gate.
- ✅ **Test Organization**:
  - Moved `test_dashboard_api.py` (Selenium/Requests) to `tests/e2e/test_dashboard_frontend.py` (requires live server).
  - Moved manual tests to `tests/manual/`.
  - Confirmed `tests/integration/` contains only API client tests (mocked/fast).
- ✅ **Gate Strictness**: Reverted "skip if server down" to ensure E2E tests strictly enforce environment requirements.
- ✅ **Label Quality**: Renamed "coverage" check to "🧪 Python Unit Tests & 📊 Coverage Analysis" in `ship_it.py` for transparency.

### Next Steps:
1. Verify PR pipeline runs with new test structure.
