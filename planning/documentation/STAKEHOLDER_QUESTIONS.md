# Stakeholder Questions List

**Purpose:** Running list of questions to ask during stakeholder meetings to validate assumptions and gather requirements.

## Data Requirements

### Accreditation Bodies
1. **Program-Specific Requirements:** Do different programs within the same institution use different accrediting bodies? (e.g., Nursing might use a different accreditor than Biology)
2. **Data Field Variations:** Are there accreditor-specific data fields required beyond the standard course information?
3. **Reporting Formats:** What specific report formats does each accrediting body require? (Word templates, PDF formats, Excel spreadsheets)

### Course Data
4. **Grade Distribution Detail:** Do you need letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) or percentage ranges? Both?
5. **Learning Outcomes:** How detailed should learning outcomes assessment be? Just pass/fail rates or specific rubric scores?
6. **Student Data:** Do you need demographic data about students, or just enrollment numbers?
7. **Assessment Methods:** How detailed should the description of assessment methods be?

### Historical Data
8. **Data Retention:** How many years of historical data do you need to maintain for accreditation purposes?
9. **Comparison Requirements:** Do accreditors require year-over-year comparisons or trend analysis?
10. **Archive vs Active:** When does course data become "historical" vs "current"?

## Workflow & Process

### User Roles & Permissions
11. **Department Structure:** Do you have sub-departments within programs? (e.g., Molecular Biology within Biology Department)
12. **Multi-Program Faculty:** Do instructors commonly teach across multiple programs/departments?
13. **Approval Workflows:** Do course reports need approval before submission to accreditors?
14. **Data Entry Responsibility:** Who typically enters course data - instructors themselves or administrative staff?

### Reporting Cycles
15. **Reporting Frequency:** How often do you submit reports to accreditors? (Annual, bi-annual, on-demand)
16. **Deadlines:** What are typical deadlines for report submission?
17. **Review Process:** Who reviews reports before submission? How long does review take?

### Data Sources
18. **Current Tools:** What systems do you currently use? (LMS, SIS, Excel, Word documents)
19. **Data Export:** Can you export data from existing systems? In what formats?
20. **Manual vs Automated:** What percentage of your current process is manual data entry vs automated?

## Technical Requirements

### Integration Needs
21. **LMS Integration:** Do you need to pull data directly from your Learning Management System?
22. **SIS Integration:** Should we integrate with your Student Information System?
23. **Export Requirements:** What file formats do you need for exports? (PDF, Word, Excel, CSV)

### Access & Security
24. **Multi-Institution Users:** Do you have faculty/staff who work at multiple institutions?
25. **External Access:** Do accreditors need direct access to the system, or do you always export reports?
26. **Audit Requirements:** Do you need detailed audit logs of who changed what and when?

## Business Model Validation

### Pricing & Value
27. **Budget Authority:** Who has authority to purchase software tools for your department/institution?
28. **Current Costs:** What do you currently spend on accreditation reporting (staff time, consultant fees, software)?
29. **ROI Calculation:** How do you typically calculate return on investment for new tools?
30. **Procurement Process:** What's your typical process for evaluating and purchasing new software?

### Feature Priorities
31. **Must-Have vs Nice-to-Have:** Which features are absolutely critical vs nice-to-have?
32. **Pain Points:** What's the biggest frustration with your current process?
33. **Success Metrics:** How would you measure success of a new system?

## Implementation & Adoption

### Change Management
34. **User Training:** How much training time is realistic for your users?
35. **Rollout Strategy:** Would you prefer to pilot with one program or roll out institution-wide?
36. **Support Needs:** What level of ongoing support would you expect?

### Timeline & Urgency
37. **Implementation Timeline:** When would you ideally want a new system in place?
38. **Upcoming Deadlines:** Do you have any critical accreditation deadlines coming up?
39. **Current System Limitations:** What problems with your current process need immediate attention?

## Questions Added During Development

40. **Program-Specific Data Requirements:** Are there specific data fields that vary by accrediting body that we should plan for?

## CEI-Specific Questions (From Video & Spreadsheet Analysis)

### **Hierarchy & Structure**
41. **Learning Outcome Hierarchy:** How do CLOs (Course Learning Outcomes) roll up to Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs)?
42. **Institutional Outcomes:** Are there Institutional Learning Outcomes (ILOs) that programs contribute to?
43. **NWCCU Structure:** What's the complete hierarchy from course level up to NWCCU submission?
44. **Assessment Cycles:** What are the different reporting cycles (annual, 3-year, 7-year)?

### **Current System Pain Points**
45. **Access Database Issues:** How severe are the multi-user concurrency problems?
46. **Data Integrity:** How often do records end up in wrong rows or get corrupted?
47. **Form Usability:** What specific problems do faculty have with current Access forms?
48. **Manual Reconciliation:** How much time is spent on manual math validation?

### **Reporting Requirements**
49. **Required Reports:** What specific reports does NWCCU require for your accreditation?
50. **Report Formats:** Do final submissions need to be PDF, Word, Excel, or other formats?
51. **Approval Workflow:** Who reviews and approves reports before submission?
52. **Submission Timeline:** When are reports due and how long does compilation take?

### **Views & Dashboards**
53. **Faculty Views:** What data do instructors need to see about their courses?
54. **Program Views:** What cross-course data do program administrators need?
55. **Institution Views:** What institution-wide data is needed for reporting?
56. **Real-time vs Static:** Do you need live dashboards or are periodic reports sufficient?

### **Migration & Integration**
57. **Access Export:** Would exporting web data to Access format help during transition?
58. **Parallel Operation:** Could you run both systems simultaneously during evaluation?
59. **Data Migration:** How important is importing your existing 1,543 CLO records?
60. **Custom Branding:** Would CSS upload for university styling be valuable?
