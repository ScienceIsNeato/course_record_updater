# Coverage configuration for 80% threshold
# Use these options when running tests with coverage:
# pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80

# Dev cycle shortcuts (use from command line):
# Fast iteration (skip slow tests, stop on first failure):
#   pytest tests/unit/ -m "not slow" -x -q
# Only re-run failed tests:
#   pytest tests/unit/ --lf -q
# Run tests related to changed files (requires pytest-testmon):
#   pytest tests/unit/ --testmon
# Full suite with coverage:
#   pytest tests/unit/ --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80
