## Key Relationships

### User Access Pattern
```
User → UserProgramAccess → Program → Courses
User → Course (via created_by_user_id or shared_with_user_ids)
```

### Data Hierarchy
```
Institution (1) → (many) Programs (1) → (many) Courses (1) → (many) CourseOutcomes (CLOs)
                                                        (1) → (many) CourseInstructors
                (1) → (many) FormConfigurations
                (1) → (many) CustomFields
```

### Invitation Flows
```
# Program Access
ProgramAdmin → ProgramInvitation → Email → NewUser/ExistingUser → UserProgramAccess

# Course Sharing  
CourseOwner → CourseInvitation → Email → NewUser/ExistingUser → Course.shared_with_user_ids

# Instructor Assignment
CourseOwner → Add Instructor → Create Pending User → CourseInstructor created → Email Invitation → User completes registration → User.account_status = 'active'
```

## User Experience & Access Control

### Program Selection Logic
**For Course Creation:**
- **Institution Administrator:** Shows dropdown of all programs in their institution(s)
- **Program Administrator:** 
  - If assigned to only 1 program: Program auto-selected (hidden field)
  - If assigned to multiple programs: Shows dropdown of their assigned programs
- **Regular User:**
  - If member of only 1 program: Program auto-selected (hidden field)  
  - If member of multiple programs: Shows dropdown of their accessible programs

**Business Rule:** A course belongs to exactly one program

### Row-Level Security
- All queries automatically filter by user's accessible programs
- Institution admins see all programs in their institution
- Program admins see only their assigned programs  
- Regular users see only programs they're members of

### Invitation Security
- Invitation tokens are UUIDs (non-guessable)
- 7-day expiration
- One-time use
- Email verification required
- Can handle both new user signup and existing user addition

### Audit Trail
- All course modifications tracked via `last_modified_by_user_id`
- Invitation grants tracked via `granted_by_user_id`
- Timestamps on all major actions

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Multi-Instructor Courses:** How do we handle team-taught courses?
   - Just use `instructor_name` field (may differ from `created_by_user_id`)?
   - Allow multiple people to edit the same course instance?

2. **Data Retention:** How long do we keep:
   - Revoked user access records?
   - Expired invitations?
   - Archived course instances?

3. **Accreditor Flexibility:** Should `learning_outcomes_data` be:
   - Completely flexible JSON?
   - Semi-structured with common fields + custom fields?
   - Separate tables per accreditor?
