## Pricing Variables to Determine

### Per-Course Pricing ($X)
**Considerations:**
- Course complexity varies (1 credit vs 4 credit courses)
- Should pricing be per-course or per-credit-hour?
- Seasonal usage (higher in fall/spring, lower in summer)

**Potential Models:**
1. **Flat per-course:** $2-5 per course per month
2. **Credit-hour based:** $1 per credit hour per month
3. **Enrollment based:** $0.50 per enrolled student per month
4. **Hybrid:** Base course fee + per-student fee

### Market Positioning
**Competitor Analysis Needed:**
- What do existing solutions charge?
- How do they structure pricing?
- What's the typical budget for department-level tools?

**Value-Based Pricing:**
- How much time/money does this save vs manual processes?
- What's the cost of accreditation compliance failures?
- ROI calculation for institutions

## Freemium Strategy

### Free Tier Goals
1. **User Acquisition:** Low barrier to entry
2. **Product Validation:** Real usage data from free users
3. **Viral Growth:** Free users become advocates within institutions
4. **Conversion Funnel:** Natural upgrade path when needs grow

### Trial Management Strategy

**During Trial (30 days):**
- Unlimited access to all features
- No restrictions on courses, programs, or institutions
- Gentle reminders at days 14, 21, 28 about trial ending

**After Trial Ends or Payment Missed:**
- **Account immediately becomes read-only**
- **Read-only access:** View all data, export data, generate reports
- **No editing:** Cannot add/edit/delete courses, programs, or invite users
- **Data preserved indefinitely:** All data remains intact
- **Simple reactivation:** Pay subscription → full access restored immediately

**No Shady Tactics:**
- No data deletion threats
- No artificial limitations on exports
- No grace periods with daily spam emails
- Just pay to use the product, don't pay to view your data

### Conversion Triggers
**Free → Program Tier:**
- User wants to invite colleagues
- Need for program-level reporting
- Managing multiple related courses
- Trial period ends

**Program → Institution Tier:**
- Managing multiple departments
- Need for cross-program reporting
- Volume pricing becomes attractive

## Revenue Projections

### Conservative Estimates
**Assumptions:**
- $X = $3 per course
- Average program: 15 courses
- Average institution: 3 programs (45 courses)

**Monthly Revenue per Customer:**
- Program Tier: $19.99 + (15 × $3) = $64.99
- Institution Tier: $39.99 + (45 × $2.25) = $141.24

**Annual Revenue Targets:**
- 100 Program customers: $77,988 ARR
- 50 Institution customers: $84,744 ARR
- Combined: $162,732 ARR

### Growth Scenarios
**Year 1:** Focus on Program tier, build product-market fit
**Year 2:** Institution tier growth, feature expansion
**Year 3:** Multi-region expansion, enterprise features
