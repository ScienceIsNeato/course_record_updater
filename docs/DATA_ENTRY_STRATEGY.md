# Data Entry Strategy & AI Integration

## Core Philosophy
**Minimize user effort, maximize accuracy** - Accept any input format and use AI to extract structured data.

## MVP Approach: Traditional Forms + Smart Adapters

### Primary Interface
- **Traditional web forms** - point and click system
- **File upload capability** - for document processing
- **Manual data entry** as reliable fallback

### Smart Adapter System
- **Document upload** - Accept various file formats
- **AI-powered parsing** - Extract structured data from documents
- **User validation** - Present extracted data for confirmation
- **Learning capability** - Improve over time based on corrections

## Expected Input Variability (Future Phases)

### Document Types
- **Photos of documents** (handwritten notes, printed reports)
- **Excel spreadsheets** (various formats and layouts)
- **Email screenshots** (grade reports, enrollment summaries)
- **PDF reports** from LMS systems
- **Word documents** (syllabi, assessment reports)

### AI Processing Pipeline (Future)
1. **Input Classification:** Determine input type (image, document, structured data)
2. **Content Extraction:** OCR for images, parsing for documents
3. **Data Structure Recognition:** Identify key fields (course number, semester, grades, etc.)
4. **Validation & Confirmation:** Present extracted data to user for verification
5. **Learning Loop:** Improve extraction based on user corrections

## Required Data Fields

### Core Fields
- Course number/identifier
- Semester/term
- Academic year
- Number of students
- Grade distribution (A, B, C, D, F percentages or counts)
- Instructor information
- Program/department affiliation

### Optional/Contextual Fields
- Learning outcomes assessment
- Pass/fail rates
- Withdrawal rates
- Course modality (online, in-person, hybrid)

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Traditional forms with validation
- Basic file upload (manual processing)
- Simple document adapters (like current dummy adapter)

### Phase 2 (AI Enhancement)
- AI-powered document processing
- Smart field extraction and validation
- Machine learning improvements based on user feedback
