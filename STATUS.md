## SonarCloud Issues (In Progress)

### Blockers Identified
1. **Security Rating on New Code**: 2/5 (need 1/5) ❌
2. **Coverage on New Code**: 70.5% (need 80%) ❌

### Progress Made ✅
**Cognitive Complexity Fix (1/5 critical issues)**
- ✅ Refactored `LoginService.authenticate_user()` from complexity 18 → ~12
- Extracted `_validate_account_status()` helper method
- Replaced nested if/elif with dictionary lookup
- Maintains all functionality and error messages

### Remaining Work

**Critical Issues (4 remaining)**
- ❌ api_routes.py:2484 - Cognitive Complexity 17 (need 15)
- ⚠️  api_routes.py string literal constants (may be false positive - already using constants)

**Coverage Gap (Main Blocker)**
- Need ~40 more covered lines (out of 398 uncovered) to reach 80%
- Focus areas:
  - api_routes.py: 228 uncovered (error paths, validation)
  - database_sqlite.py: 145 uncovered (error handling)
  - audit_service.py: 12 uncovered
  - database_service.py: 9 uncovered
  - app.py: 4 uncovered

**Accessibility Issues (23 major)**
- Template form labels need proper associations
- `role="status"` should be `<output>` elements
- Low priority - doesn't block PR merge

## Latest CI Fixes (Oct 12, 2025)

### CI Test Failures Resolved ✅

**1. E2E Adapter Loading Error**
- Fixed double-fetching issue in data_management_panel.html
- Now silently skips adapter loading if dropdowns don't exist

**2. Integration Test Failures (8 tests)**
- Updated tests to expect correct data after dashboard bug fix
- Program admin tests now expect actual program/course counts (not 0)

**3. Smoke Test Failure (1 test)**
- Corrected test assumption about program_admin permissions

**4. API Bug Fix: Program Deletion KeyError**
- Added defensive handling for both 'program_id' and 'id' keys

## Test Suite Status

### All Local Tests Passing ✅
- **Unit Tests**: 1088 passing
- **Integration Tests**: 145 passing
- **Smoke Tests**: 29 passing
- **E2E Tests**: 35/35 passing (100%) ✅
- **Test Coverage**: 81.45% (local) vs 70.5% (SonarCloud "new code")

### Quality Gates (Local)
- ✅ All pre-commit hooks passing (~40s)
- ✅ Code formatting (black, isort, prettier)
- ✅ Linting (flake8, pylint, ESLint)
- ✅ Type checking (mypy)
- ✅ Test coverage >80%
- ❌ SonarCloud coverage on new code <80% (PR blocker)

## Strategy for Coverage Gap

The discrepancy between local coverage (81.45%) and SonarCloud "new code" coverage (70.5%) suggests:
1. SonarCloud only counts coverage for lines modified in this PR
2. Many new error handling paths are untested
3. Need targeted tests for validation logic and error paths

**Approach:**
1. ✅ Fix critical cognitive complexity issues first (1/2 done)
2. 🔄 Add tests for most common error paths (quick wins)
3. 🔄 Focus on simple validation failures that are easy to test
4. 🔄 Aim for 40+ newly covered lines to reach 80% threshold

---

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining cognitive complexity issue in api_routes.py
2. Add tests for error validation in api_routes.py (focus on 400-level errors)
3. Add tests for database error handling
4. Re-run SonarCloud analysis to verify improvements
5. Address accessibility issues if time permits (non-blocking)

**Target**: Green SonarCloud quality gate → Merge PR → Production deployment
