# Session Context 🕒

## Core Rules

### Status Tracking
- **Mandatory**: At the beginning of each new interaction or when re-engaging after a pause, **ALWAYS** read the `STATUS.md` file to understand the current state.
- Keep track of what you are doing in a `STATUS.md` file.
- Refer to and update the `STATUS.md` file **at the completion of each significant step or sub-task**, and before switching context or ending an interaction.
- Update `STATUS.md` **immediately** if new information changes the plan or task status.
- Periodically check to see what the previous steps have been and look for antipatterns, like oscillating between two bad solutions or getting the same results no matter what we try. This review should also consider the `STATUS.md`.
