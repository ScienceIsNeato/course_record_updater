# CEI Focused Approach: Executive Summary

**Date:** December 20, 2024  
**Strategic Pivot:** From generic course record system to focused instructor management platform  
**Key Insight:** Leslie's need to "push out the data and pull it back" efficiently

---

## The Problem We're Solving

**Current Situation at CEI:**
- 145 faculty members across multiple programs (Biology, Nursing, Business, etc.)
- 173 courses with 1,543 Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) requiring assessment
- Manual process using "bubble gum and duct tape" Microsoft Access system
- Multi-user concurrency issues causing data corruption and lost work
- Time-consuming manual follow-up with instructors for assessment completion

**Leslie's Pain Points:**
- Spending excessive time chasing down individual instructors
- Manual coordination of course assignments and deadlines
- Data quality issues requiring constant review and correction
- Difficulty generating timely reports for accreditation (NWCCU)
- Poor instructor experience leading to delayed or incomplete assessments
