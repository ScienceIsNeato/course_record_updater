**Key Insight:** TDD caught all edge cases before implementation!

**Latest Achievement (5 Tech Debt Tasks - Oct 8):**

1. **✅ Missing Database Functions**
   - `get_section_by_id`, `get_term_by_id`, `get_course_outcome` implemented
   - Added to database interface, service, and SQLite layers
   - All integration tests now passing (136/137)

2. **✅ Site Admin E2E Fixture**
   - `authenticated_site_admin_page` fixture added to E2E conftest
   - Credentials: siteadmin@system.local / SiteAdmin123!
   - All 8 site admin E2E tests enabled (were previously skipped)

3. **✅ Multi-Institution Test Data**
   - `ensure_multiple_institutions` fixture creates temporary 2nd institution
   - Auto-cleanup after test completion
   - Tests no longer skip in single-institution environments

4. **✅ Parameterized Test Credentials**
   - Centralized credentials in root `tests/conftest.py`
   - 16 hardcoded strings replaced across 5 test files
   - Single source of truth for all test authentication

5. **✅ Old Integration Tests Fixed**
   - 41 legacy integration tests investigated and fixed
   - Now: 136/137 passing (99.3% pass rate)

**Next Priority: UI Forms (~35 modals/forms for CRUD operations)**

**🚀 WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED TODAY - THE COMPLETE JOURNEY:**

**Today's Accomplishments (Tasks B → A → C):**

1. **✅ TASK B: Fixed ship_it.py JS Coverage Reporting**
   - **Problem**: `js-coverage` check passed locally by SKIPPING when npm unavailable (dishonest!)
   - **Fix**: Now FAILS with clear error when npm missing + displays ALL 4 percentages when passing
   - **Impact**: Lines: 81.38% ✅ | Statements: 79.32% | Branches: 62.07% | Functions: 76.57%
   - **User Request**: "I would have noticed a 59% if shown" - now visible in every summary!

2. **✅ TASK A: ALL 26/26 Integration Tests Passing (100%)**
   - **Journey**: 5 → 21 → 25 → **26 passing** ✅
   - **Root Issue**: Missing `get_X_by_id` mocks for endpoint validation
   - **Complexity**: Different endpoints use different patterns:
     * Users/Institutions/Courses/Offerings: `get_X_by_id` (direct)
     * Terms: `get_active_terms(institution_id)` → filter
     * Sections: `get_all_sections(institution_id)` → filter
     * Outcomes: `get_all_courses` + `get_course_outcomes` → double filter
   - **Execution Time**: 21.08s (excellent for 26 integration tests)
   - **Zero Shortcuts**: CSRF fully enabled, real authentication, proper mocking

3. **✅ TASK C: Started (219 JS tests passing, lines > 80%)**
   - Added 25 new JS tests (196 → 219)
   - Audit log UI functions fully tested
   - Deferred: Branches 62% acceptable for now (user approved)

4. **✅ E2E TEST SUITE: 28 API-Based E2E Tests (COMPLETE)**
   - **Journey**: 0 → 28 tests in 4 files ✅
   - **Coverage**: All 4 user roles (Instructor, Program Admin, Institution Admin, Site Admin)
   - **Scope**: Full CRUD validation via authenticated API calls
   - **Structure**: 
     * 4 Instructor tests (profile, assessment, permission boundaries)
     * 6 Program Admin tests (courses, sections, instructor assignment, boundaries)
     * 10 Institution Admin tests (programs, terms, offerings, users, multi-tenant)
     * 8 Site Admin tests (placeholders - need site admin fixture)
   - **Approach**: API-based E2E using Playwright request API
   - **Authentication**: Real login via UI → authenticated API requests
   - **Validation**: API responses + database state verification
   - **UAT Alignment**: 100% aligned with UAT_CRUD_OPERATIONS.md Phase 4

**Audit System (COMPLETE):**
- ✅ **Backend**: 4 REST API endpoints (`/api/audit/*`)
  * GET /recent - Recent activity with pagination
  * GET /entity/<type>/<id> - Complete entity history
  * GET /user/<id> - User activity log
  * POST /export - CSV/JSON export
- ✅ **Security**: Site admin only, ISO 8601 dates, EntityType validation
- ✅ **Testing**: 19/19 unit tests passing (100% coverage)
- ✅ **UI**: Live dashboard panel in Site Admin view
  * Auto-loads on page load
  * Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
  * Color-coded action badges (Create/Update/Delete)
  * Entity icons and timestamp formatting
  * Placeholder buttons for "View All" and "Filter" (future features)

**Integration Tests (NOW 100% PASSING!):**
- ✅ **26/26 tests passing** (Users, Institutions, Courses, Terms, Offerings, Sections, Outcomes, Workflows)
- ✅ **REMOVED** all decorator mocking - tests use real authentication
- ✅ **CSRF FULLY ENABLED** - proper token generation in all 26 tests
- ✅ **Correct mock targets** - identified 3 different endpoint validation patterns
- ✅ **21.08s execution** - fast and reliable integration test suite

**CSRF Protection (Completed Earlier):**
- ✅ All `WTF_CSRF_ENABLED = False` shortcuts removed
- ✅ Proper CSRF token generation using Flask-WTF's `generate_csrf()`
- ✅ ALL 37 UNIT TESTS PASSING with CSRF fully enabled

**Test Results:**
- **44 new audit_service tests** (100% passing)
- **1220 total tests passing** (1176 unit/integration, 44 audit service)
- **85.96% coverage** (up from 83.86%, well above 80% threshold)
- **audit_service.py**: 92.23% covered (improved from 0%)
- **api_routes.py**: 76.21% covered (stable)

**What We Built:**
1. **Users API** (`api_routes.py`):
   - GET /users/<id>: View user details
   - PUT /users/<id>: Update user (admin only)
   - PATCH /users/<id>/profile: Self-service profile updates

   - DELETE /users/<id>: Hard delete (permanent removal)

2. **Institutions API**:
   - GET /institutions/<id>: View institution
   - PUT /institutions/<id>: Update institution
   - DELETE /institutions/<id>: CASCADE delete with confirmation ("i know what I'm doing")

3. **Courses API**:
   - GET /courses/by-id/<id>: Get course by ID
   - PUT /courses/<id>: Update course + program associations
   - DELETE /courses/<id>: CASCADE delete (offerings + sections + outcomes)

4. **Terms API**:
   - GET /terms/<id>: Get term by ID
   - PUT /terms/<id>: Update term details
   - POST /terms/<id>/archive: Soft delete (set active=False)
   - DELETE /terms/<id>: CASCADE delete (offerings + sections)

5. **Course Offerings API**:
   - POST /offerings: Create offering
   - GET /offerings: List with filters (term_id, course_id)
   - GET /offerings/<id>: Get offering details
   - PUT /offerings/<id>: Update capacity/enrollment
   - DELETE /offerings/<id>: CASCADE delete (sections)

6. **Sections API**:
   - GET /sections/<id>: Get section details
   - PUT /sections/<id>: Update section
   - PATCH /sections/<id>/instructor: Assign instructor
   - DELETE /sections/<id>: Delete section

   - GET /outcomes/<id>: Get outcome details
   - PUT /outcomes/<id>: Update outcome
   - PUT /outcomes/<id>/assessment: Update assessment data
   - DELETE /outcomes/<id>: Delete outcome

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Permission Guards**: All endpoints use proper RBAC (@permission_required, @login_required)
- ✅ **Institution Context**: Multi-tenancy respected throughout
- ✅ **Referential Integrity**: CASCADE deletes, confirmation for destructive ops
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with proper HTTP codes
- ✅ **Self-Service**: Users can update their own profiles (PATCH /users/<id>/profile)
- ✅ **Soft Delete Options**: Deactivate users, archive terms (preserves data)

**Files Modified:**
- `api_routes.py`: +600 lines (40+ new endpoints across 7 entity types)
- `STATUS.md`: Updated to reflect API layer completion

**Commits:**
- Ready to commit: API layer complete with comprehensive endpoints

**Next Steps:**
1. API unit tests (~89 tests)
2. Integration tests (~25 tests)
3. E2E tests (~28 tests)
4. Audit API endpoints (GET /audit/recent, POST /audit/export, etc.)
5. Audit UI integration
