Great. I’ll investigate the pain points in tracking Specific Aims in departments like Biology, estimate the number of potential U.S. community college customers, identify niche tools addressing this problem (if any), and assess the potential MRR based on a per-course SaaS pricing model.

I'll also generate a list of other potential users who might benefit from such a product.

I'll let you know when the research is ready for review.


# Tracking Specific Aims in Community College Courses – Viability Study

## A. Pain Point Analysis: Challenges in Tracking Course Aims

Tracking course-level learning outcomes (“Specific Aims”) across multiple courses is notoriously difficult in U.S. community colleges. Faculty often find it frustrating when students fail to carry skills from one course to the next, revealing gaps in how course aims align across a program. In biology departments, for example, instructors may expect students to have mastered certain lab or analytical skills in *Intro Biology* before *Biology II*, only to discover those outcomes were never adequately covered – a disjointed learning experience that frustrates both professors and students. Key pain points include:

* **Fragmented Data & Tools:** Many colleges still use ad-hoc methods (Excel grids, Word docs) to map and report outcomes alignment. One college described a “catch-as-catch-can system of spreadsheets” for assessment, with too many people spending too much time collecting data – and the data still coming in slowly and inconsistently. Such siloed tracking makes it hard to get a *single source of truth* on which courses address which departmental aims.
* **Adjunct Faculty & Participation:** Community colleges rely heavily on adjunct instructors, who teach as a second job and have little time or incentive for extra paperwork. Engaging part-time faculty in outcomes tracking is a major challenge – in one survey, only 29% of community-college leaders agreed that faculty were the primary drivers of learning-outcomes assessment, and most adjuncts were *not* involved. The result is patchy data, since many course sections might not report how they meet program aims at all.
* **Workload and Resistance:** Even full-time faculty often see outcomes reporting as a burdensome *“PITA”* (“pain in the ass”), detracting from time spent on teaching. A biology professor lamented that the push to quantify every outcome for accreditors left “less time to devote to \[teaching] subject matter” that students already struggle with in Intro Biology. Without a streamlined process, tracking Specific Aims feels like added busywork on top of heavy teaching loads.
* **Consistency and Alignment Issues:** Ensuring consistency across courses and sections is difficult without dedicated tools. Curriculum mapping is often “time-consuming and frustrating” when done manually or with systems not integrated into actual courses. Faculty may not realize where gaps or overlaps in outcome coverage exist. As HelioCampus (an ed-tech provider) notes, *“course syllabi must be standardized to align with key outcomes… \[but] training and implementation \[are] an immovable obstacle”* in many colleges. The lack of transparency across courses leads to misaligned expectations – for instance, students held accountable for skills that were never taught prior, an “unpleasant experience for professors” and a disservice to learners.

In summary, community college educators express clear frustration with the current process of tracking course-level outcomes. The pain comes from juggling disparate data sources, chasing input from busy adjuncts, and trying to manually map a complex web of courses to program or institutional goals. This challenge is especially evident in disciplines like biology, where sequential courses build on each other and any misalignment in Specific Aims immediately hinders student progress.

## B. Market Sizing: Community College Segment

The U.S. community college sector is large and highly outcome-focused, suggesting a substantial addressable market for a Specific Aims tracking solution. There are approximately **1,100** community colleges in the United States (around 1,071 degree-granting two-year institutions reporting data in 2019-20). Essentially all accredited community colleges must assess student learning outcomes and align courses with program or institutional goals to satisfy accreditation standards. In practice, this means *nearly every community college* could be a viable user of a tool that streamlines outcome tracking.

To estimate potential usage, consider a typical community college’s scope of courses and departments, using Biology as an example: most community colleges offer biology courses (for general education, allied health, or transfer programs), and these courses have to meet certain departmental or general education outcomes. We assume each institution has an average of \~10 academic departments (or program areas) actively tracking outcomes, with each department offering around 5 distinct courses per semester that need outcome alignment. The table below summarizes a rough market sizing:

| Scope                            | Number of Institutions | Departments (est.) | Courses Tracked per Semester (est.) |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Per Community College (avg.)** | 1                      | \~10               | \~50 (e.g. 5 courses × 10 depts)    |
| **All U.S. Community Colleges**  | \~1,100                | \~11,000           | \~55,000 courses total              |

*Table: Estimated scale of outcome-tracking needs in U.S. community colleges.* (Each college averages about 10 departments engaged in assessment, with \~50 courses to track each semester across those departments. Across \~1,100 institutions, this implies on the order of 50k+ course-outcome mappings per term sector-wide.)

Not every college will have the same numbers – larger community colleges may have more departments and courses, while smaller ones combine disciplines (for instance, a single Science department overseeing biology, chemistry, etc.). However, virtually all will have **some mechanism to track course-level outcomes** in programs like Biology, Nursing, English, etc., because regional accreditors demand evidence of curriculum-outcome alignment. This means the potential user base (at least in theory) spans the majority of the \~1,100 colleges. Even if only a fraction are early adopters of a new SaaS, the absolute number is significant. For example, 10% of this market would be \~110 institutions (thousands of courses), and even a 1% penetration (about 10–11 colleges) could involve hundreds of courses being tracked using the platform. In short, the community college sector offers a sizable niche market, with *tens of thousands of course outcomes* that could be managed more efficiently with a specialized tool.

Moreover, a focus on *program-specific tracking* (like a Biology department’s aims across its courses) could be a strong entry point. Biology is a nearly universal offering at community colleges, and these departments often need to map courses (e.g. **Biology I**, **Biology II**, **Anatomy & Physiology**, **Microbiology**) to broader outcomes such as scientific reasoning, lab skills, or preparation for allied health programs. A solution that demonstrates value in one department could then expand horizontally to other departments within the same institution, leveraging similar needs in disciplines like Math, English, etc. The market sizing above therefore also hints at expansion potential: a foothold in one department (per college) could translate into supporting many departments per college over time.

## C. Competitive Landscape: Existing Tools for Outcome Alignment

While most Learning Management Systems (LMS) have basic outcome tracking features, few specialized tools focus narrowly on aligning course-level outcomes with program or institutional aims. This is a *niche* within the broader ed-tech and assessment market. Key existing solutions include:

* **eLumen** – A dedicated curriculum and assessment management platform popular in community colleges. eLumen enables mapping student learning outcomes (SLOs) from the course level up to program and institutional levels, and it replaces manual processes with an integrated database. For example, San Antonio College adopted eLumen after using spreadsheets for assessment; too many people were “spending too much time to capture data” and the data were still slow and imprecise. With eLumen, faculty enter assessment results directly, and administrators can easily see which courses address each program outcome. **Adoption:** eLumen is used by many institutions, including large community college districts. The Contra Costa Community College District (CA) noted that “so many California Community Colleges have chosen eLumen,” allowing them to leverage best practices from peers. **Pricing:** eLumen’s pricing is not publicly listed (it’s typically licensed campus-wide), but the model is institutional subscriptions based on features and scale. (For context, similar assessment tools often charge annual fees in the tens of thousands USD for a full institution license.)

* **Watermark (Taskstream & Aqua)** – Watermark offers a suite of assessment and accreditation tools (stemming from Taskstream, LiveText, etc.) used in higher ed. Its *Curriculum Strategy* or *Planning & Self-Study* modules help faculty map curriculum to outcomes and streamline accreditation reporting. **Description:** Watermark’s platform allows creation of curriculum maps, tracking of learning outcomes data, and generation of reports for accreditors. Many colleges use Watermark to manage program review and outcomes; for instance, Piedmont Community College and others have participated in Watermark/NILOA panels on improving community college assessment, indicating active usage in the sector. **Pricing:** Watermark typically uses a campus license model; specific pricing is custom, but as a reference, comparable enterprise assessment systems often range from \~\$5,000 up to \$20,000+ per year depending on institution size and modules licensed. **Adoption Case:** Watermark has case studies (e.g., Southeast Technical College) highlighting improved assessment workflows. In general, it’s considered a comprehensive (if broad) solution rather than a point tool, which means it’s powerful but can be expensive or complex for some colleges’ narrow need.

* **Nuventive (TracDat/Nuventive Improve)** – A platform originally known as TracDat, aimed at integrating planning and outcomes assessment. **Description:** Nuventive’s system provides a central repository for student learning outcomes, program goals, and assessment results. It features *curriculum mapping*: faculty can link each course’s SLOs to program outcomes and designate whether a course *Introduces, Reinforces,* or *Emphasizes* a particular outcome. This visual map helps identify gaps or redundancies in curriculum coverage. **Adoption:** Nuventive is used by various community colleges and universities for outcomes tracking. For example, Chesapeake College (MD) uses Nuventive as a “one-stop platform” for faculty and deans to **track SLOs, submit assessment reports, and collaborate on improvement plans** in academic programs. San Diego Mesa College and others in California also use Nuventive for program review and SLO management. **Pricing:** Nuventive, like others, offers institutional licenses. Pricing is typically quote-based; anecdotally, it is similar in scale to Watermark. It may be packaged as part of a broader strategic planning suite.

* **Weave (Weave Education)** – A smaller competitor focused on simplifying assessment and accreditation for colleges. **Description:** Weave provides an online system to manage learning outcomes, assessment findings, and accreditation evidence. It’s tailored for ease of use in smaller institutions or academic departments. Weave emphasizes user-friendly reporting and has modules for curriculum mapping (e.g., aligning course outcomes to program goals) as well as accreditation self-study. **Adoption:** Weave is used by a variety of colleges and academic programs; it often highlights ease for first-time assessment efforts. (Specific community college case studies are limited, but Weave’s blog and resources indicate usage in teaching-focused institutions). **Pricing:** Weave’s pricing is not publicly posted; Capterra lists it as available by quote. Given its focus, it might offer more affordable or modular pricing, potentially a few thousand dollars for departmental use up to institution-level packages.

* **SPOL (Strategic Planning Online)** – A niche solution that includes an assessment module. **Description:** SPOL’s assessment software lets institutions map program learning outcomes to courses and curriculum, providing a *Program Assessment Map* that visually shows the relationship between outcomes and the courses in a program. It also ties assessment results into accreditation standards and strategic planning. **Adoption:** SPOL is less widely known but has a presence in community colleges and regional universities that want an integrated planning and accreditation tool. For example, some colleges in Florida and Texas have used SPOL for accreditation preparation. **Pricing:** Like others, sold as enterprise software (with modules for assessment, accreditation, etc.); likely in a similar budget range (a few thousand to tens of thousands annually depending on scope).

* **“Homegrown” or Free Approaches:** It’s worth noting that many colleges attempt to use existing tools rather than buy a niche product. Common approaches include using the LMS (e.g., Canvas Outcomes or Moodle) to tag quiz questions or assignments to outcomes, then aggregating results. However, LMS outcome features are often *“divorced from the courses \[they map]”* in terms of curriculum-wide visualization, making them time-consuming and frustrating to use for true curriculum mapping. Others simply use Google Sheets or in-house databases to tally which course covers which goal. These do not scale well – as noted earlier, reliance on spreadsheets leads to inefficiencies and poor data quality. There currently isn’t a popular open-source dedicated tool for curriculum outcome mapping in higher ed (unlike K-12 where some curriculum mapping tools like Atlas exist, albeit not free). This means the competition in many cases is the *status quo* of manual effort or repurposed general tools.

**Competitive Summary:** No dominant off-the-shelf solution specifically zeroes in on tracking Specific Aims across courses in the community college niche – but there are several adjacent players. Most competitors bundle outcome mapping with broader assessment or curriculum management functions. A new SaaS entrant could differentiate by being lightweight, affordable, and purpose-built for course-to-program outcome alignment (as opposed to an all-encompassing accreditation system). However, it would likely compete for budget against the likes of eLumen or Watermark if those are already in place, or it must convince colleges to move away from their patchwork of spreadsheets and LMS exports. Pricing and positioning (see MRR potential below) will be critical to compete in this landscape, as community colleges operate with tight budgets and will look for cost-effective solutions.

## D. MRR Potential: SaaS Pricing Scenarios

To gauge the business opportunity, we model potential Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) under a SaaS pricing model where institutions pay based on the number of courses tracked. We consider two price points – a lower-tier at **\$20 per course per month** (suitable for broad adoption) and a higher-tier at **\$50 per course per month** (if the product delivers significant value or targets specialized use). We then apply different market penetration rates (1%, 5%, 10% of the total market) to project MRR:

Assumptions for modeling: The total addressable courses is roughly 55,000 courses (per semester) across \~1,100 community colleges (from Section B). This assumes an average of \~50 courses per college that would be tracked. We treat one “course” as one course being tracked in the system (regardless of number of sections). An institution with 50 courses using the system would pay for 50 units. MRR is calculated as (Number of courses \* price per course).

| Pricing Model         | Adoption Level (of market)   | Approx. # of Courses Tracked                  | Estimated MRR (Monthly) |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **\$20/course/month** | 1% of courses (\~**550**)    | \~550 courses  (≈11 colleges \* 50 courses)   | **\$11,000** MRR        |
| **\$20/course/month** | 5% of courses (\~**2,750**)  | \~2,750 courses (≈55 colleges \* 50 courses)  | **\$55,000** MRR        |
| **\$20/course/month** | 10% of courses (\~**5,500**) | \~5,500 courses (≈110 colleges \* 50 courses) | **\$110,000** MRR       |
| **\$50/course/month** | 1% of courses (\~**550**)    | \~550 courses                                 | **\$27,500** MRR        |
| **\$50/course/month** | 5% of courses (\~**2,750**)  | \~2,750 courses                               | **\$137,500** MRR       |
| **\$50/course/month** | 10% of courses (\~**5,500**) | \~5,500 courses                               | **\$275,000** MRR       |

*Table: Projected Monthly Recurring Revenue at two price points and various market penetrations.* (Course counts rounded; 1% of market ≈ 550 courses, 5% ≈ 2,750 courses, 10% ≈ 5,500 courses. Calculations assume an average of 50 tracked courses per adopting institution.)

**Interpretation:** At a relatively modest \$20/course/month price, capturing 10% of the market (roughly 100-110 colleges) would yield around **\$110k MRR**, which annualizes to \~\$1.32 million in revenue. Even a 5% share (about 50-55 colleges) could bring in ~~\$55k MRR (~~\$660k/year). These figures suggest a viable niche business, especially if growth beyond 10% is possible. At the higher \$50/course pricing, the revenue scales proportionally higher (e.g., \$275k MRR at 10% penetration, which is \$3.3M annualized). However, \$50 per course is a premium tier – likely only achievable if the product demonstrably saves labor or consolidates other costs.

**Pricing Strategy Considerations:**

* A **tiered model** could be adopted, for instance: *Basic tier* at \$20/course for core tracking features, and a *Premium tier* at \$50/course with advanced analytics or accreditation report-generation features. This would allow budget-sensitive colleges to come in at a lower price, while those wanting more value-add (and having budget) could opt for higher tiers.
* The above scenarios show that even low penetration can sustain the product: e.g., 1% adoption at \$20 yields \~\$11k MRR, which might cover baseline costs if the operation is lean. But to be a thriving business, aiming for 5-10% (or more) is reasonable, translating to a few dozen to a hundred colleges.
* The total market could also expand if the product later targets other segments (four-year colleges, K-12 districts for curriculum mapping, etc., see Section E). That would increase the potential MRR beyond the community college numbers used here.

It’s important to note that actual contract values might not scale perfectly linearly with courses – many vendors charge per student or flat institutional fees. For instance, a college with 50 courses might prefer a flat rate (say \$1,000/month for unlimited courses). Our per-course model is a proxy to estimate willingness to pay. In practice, the SaaS could offer packages (e.g., up to X courses for \$Y/month). That said, the **MRR potential in the community college sector appears healthy**, given the critical pain point being solved. Demonstrating clear ROI (e.g., *“saves faculty N hours per semester and improves accreditation readiness”*) will be key to hitting the higher penetration scenarios.

## E. Other Potential Users and Use Cases

While the focus here is community college academic departments (like biology) tracking course-outcome alignment, the underlying problem of managing learning outcomes and curriculum alignment affects many roles and contexts. Other potential users and stakeholders who would benefit include:

* **Assessment Coordinators and Institutional Effectiveness Directors:** These administrators are responsible for overseeing student learning outcomes assessment college-wide. A tool that aggregates course-specific aims into program and institutional reports would simplify their job of demonstrating continuous improvement. They often struggle with collecting data from departments and adjuncts; an outcome tracking SaaS can centralize this process, addressing a core pain point of their role.

* **Accreditation Liaisons and Compliance Officers:** Every accredited institution (and program) must periodically report how courses meet the broader educational goals. Accreditation liaisons could use the product to quickly gather evidence that *Program X’s courses fulfill the college’s goals* (or an external standard). This could also apply to **specialized program accreditors** (for nursing, engineering tech, etc.) where mapping curriculum to accreditation standards is required. The tool would help ensure no outcome is left unassessed when preparing self-study reports.

* **Department Chairs and Program Directors:** The chair of a Biology department, for instance, is directly concerned with whether all course sections are hitting the department’s learning objectives. Chairs could use the system to monitor and refine their curriculum – seeing, for example, that *Gen Biology I* introduces certain scientific skills and *Gen Biology II* reinforces them, etc. If outcomes data show a gap, the chair can initiate a change. Chairs in any discipline (Math, English, Business) would likewise benefit from clear maps and data on their courses’ aims.

* **Faculty Committees on Curriculum or Assessment:** Many colleges have committees of faculty who coordinate general education outcomes or program outcomes. These committees (often faculty from various departments) could leverage the tool to analyze alignment across different courses and even across departments. For example, a **General Education Committee** might use it to verify that all gen-ed outcomes (like critical thinking, communication, quantitative reasoning) are taught and assessed in the required courses across the college.

* **Institutional Research (IR) Analysts:** IR offices could be secondary users, pulling data from the system to correlate with student success metrics. For instance, an IR analyst might examine whether courses that explicitly map to certain skills have higher pass rates or whether students who achieve outcomes in early courses perform better in later courses. Having a structured database of outcomes alignment (rather than disparate spreadsheets) would enable deeper analysis to inform decision-making.

* **K-12 District Curriculum Coordinators (Extended Market):** Beyond higher ed, K-12 school districts do curriculum mapping to align courses with state standards. A simplified version of the tool could appeal to curriculum coaches or coordinators in high schools who need to ensure, say, that the biology classes align with Next Generation Science Standards. (Many K-12 schools use pricey curriculum mapping tools or do it manually; a SaaS could potentially tap this with adjustments, although selling to K-12 has its own challenges.)

* **Workforce Training and Corporate Education:** In other contexts, those who design training programs (e.g., at large companies or vocational training centers) face a similar need – ensuring each module or course in a training sequence meets specific competency goals. A corporate training manager or an adult education coordinator might use a “specific aims” tracking tool to map training courses to required job competencies or certification standards, ensuring no required skill is missed in the curriculum.

Each of these user profiles shares the fundamental challenge: **aligning the parts (courses, modules, or training sessions) with the whole (program goals, institutional goals, or standards)**, and tracking progress over time. They would value a solution that makes alignment visible and maintenance of that alignment easy – through centralized data, intuitive mapping interfaces, and automatic reporting. By targeting community colleges first (where the pain is acute and resources are limited), the SaaS can build a strong use case, which can later be generalized to these other domains. The emphasis on U.S. community colleges grounds the opportunity in a tangible market with clear needs, but the broader concept of outcome tracking has cross-cutting relevance wherever outcomes and learning objectives must be documented and met.
