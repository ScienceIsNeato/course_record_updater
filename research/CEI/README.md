## Research Materials

### Video Walkthrough

- **URL:** https://go.screenpal.com/watch/cTjqopn2t59
- **Content:** Leslie's walkthrough of their current outcomes data process
- **Value:** Shows real-world workflow that our system needs to replace

### Data Files
- **Source:** Attached spreadsheet from Leslie's email (July 11, 2025)
- **Content:** Actual outcomes data in their current format
- **Value:** Real data structure to inform our data model

## Key Insights from Email

### Stakeholder Engagement
- Both contacts are enthusiastic about the project
- Leslie is the "Faculty Assessment Champion" - perfect domain expert
- They're ready to meet and share detailed requirements
- This validates there's real demand for our solution

### Current Process Pain Points
- Manual spreadsheet-based process (evidenced by attached file)
- Time-intensive enough that Leslie created a 5-minute explanation video
- Complex enough to need a dedicated "Assessment Champion" role
- Perfect target for our automation solution

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Watch the video** - understand their current workflow
2. **Analyze the spreadsheet** - map to our data model
3. **Schedule stakeholder meeting** - use our prepared questions
4. **Validate assumptions** - check our docs against their reality

### Meeting Preparation
- Use `STAKEHOLDER_QUESTIONS.md` from planning/documentation
- Bring `PERMISSION_MATRIX.md` for feature validation
- Show `PRICING_STRATEGY.md` to gauge budget fit
- Demo our understanding with `DATA_MODEL.md`

## Research Value

This is **exactly** what we needed:
- ✅ Real stakeholder with domain expertise
- ✅ Actual data in current format  
- ✅ Process documentation (video)
- ✅ Decision maker engagement (Dean Taylor)
- ✅ Validation of market need

Perfect timing for our planning phase!
