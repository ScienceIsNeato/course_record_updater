the database that we have what you're looking at is data that I've Generated off of my base that we have what you're looking at is data that I've generated off of my My database is an access database that I kind of have held together with bubble gum and duct tape while it builds my database Where we went into problems is I can get to a feed But it probably is going to need to get exported to something where the data can be collected from the faculty and then brought back into the Database or perhaps there's a way within access that it can be deployed to faculty What we've run into is row locking problems where we'll have multiple people on the database Typing and things just go into random rows instead of attaching to the class So let me walk you through this just a little bit These are some of the courses that we teach and then I have this combo field which has the course and the instructor You'll notice that Abby is listed three times here. That's because she has three close Course level outcomes that she deals with Excuse me, but all three of those rows are actually one course In that course is 14 students Enrolled one student has dropped She would fill out how many past how many got a DC or incomplete. We would be able to calculate Well, we'll calculate we'll talk about calculating in a minute Then for each clue she has to say how many students pass the assessment for that clue how many took it That gives us a computation of the percentage of students that met that competency And a result either an S or a U for the result then she does a narrative for the class It doesn't make as much sense here It makes a little more sense if I were to group it that you can sort of see that one course to mini-clothe Relationship, but it makes a lot more sense if you look at it within the form. So this is the exact same thing Um Yeah, this is the exact this is what the form is don't judge me. I can't build forms, but it's functional Okay, here's the course. It's Abby's class. Here's her 14 students enrolled one student W'd 11 students past two students DC if and then that all the math all works out that 14 minus 1 minus 11 minus 2 comes out to 0 Sometimes they can't reconcile it so then they can check mark this and I can check it off of an official report later We have the pass rate, which is the 11 divided by the 14 Anyway, okay, so when we get down to the close She has a specific assessment tool that she uses for that particular course outcome Nine students passed out of the 13 students that took it that was 69 percent pass rate Which is below a 75 percent. So it comes out to be a you Um, and then we have the narrative here um Where we're running into problems actually maybe I'm just gonna pop over here and here's one that's not filled out This is a a backup of a backup. So it doesn't really matter Um, maybe we have two students that passed one student Dfic'd um when we move down to here to celebrations. There'll be some texts challenges. There'll be some text Changes, there'll be some text um for the assessment tool Maybe two people took it or passed it three people took it right so um Um, yeah, maybe three out of three here And maybe one out of the three here Um something along those lines Anyway, so you can kind of see how this thing works The form is not great. It has the elements that it needs in it Um, but the trick for us is going to be to figure out How do we get from this feed to a form that faculty can fill out that comes back to Some sort of a data feed that can then be uploaded back into access and match correctly So that's kind of where we're at. I'm going to go ahead and send you this spreadsheet Um, this is sort of the feed I'll go ahead and take the subtotal off But you can see that one to many relationship Here is this is screenshot of the form And here is how I have the relationships set up So hopefully this is helpful as a basis for our conversation, which I am Very much looking forward to thanks so much, Matt And will
