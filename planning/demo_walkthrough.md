# Reusable Demo Walkthrough (Draft)

> Narrative script for giving the demo. Update in place as we refine the storyline.  
> Supporting work items live in `planning/demo-walkthrough-checklist.md`.

## Why This Demo
- Show how a multi-tenant institution can plan, execute, and audit a semester’s assessment cycle without bespoke scripting.
- Prove the hybrid natural-key architecture (sessions survive reseeds), streamlined course management, automated reminders, and audit close-out.

## Personas & Credentials
| Role | Login | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Institution Admin | `demo2025.admin@example.com` / `Demo2024!` | Primary narrator; edits programs/courses, runs reminders & audits |
| Biology Faculty | `faculty.biology@example.com` / `Demo2024!` | Receives invites/reminders, submits CLO evidence |
| Nursing Faculty (optional) | `faculty.nursing@example.com` / `Demo2024!` | Provides “pending/missing evidence” contrast |

## Environment Reset
```bash
activate
python scripts/seed_db.py --demo --clear --env dev
./restart_server.sh dev     # requires env arg (dev/e2e)
```
- Visit `/logout` before logging back in if cookies linger.
- Demo runs at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Storyboard Snapshot
1. **Programs & Courses** – update descriptions, duplicate `BIOL-201`, attach to multiple programs, re-import Excel to show idempotence.
2. **Faculty Access & Reminders** – invite biology instructor, prove reminder job + email preview logging.
3. **Assessment Submission** – faculty submits CLO data with evidence; admin reviews.
4. **Audit Closeout** – approve Biology submission, reject Nursing, export reports, highlight dashboard changes.

## Artifacts to Capture
- Screenshots → `artifacts/` (program edits, duplicate modal, reminder toast, faculty submission, dashboard panels).
- Logs → `logs/email.log`, `logs/server.log`, optional `logs/import_flow.log`.
- Exports → `demo_artifacts/audit/*.csv|pdf`.

## Talking Points
- Natural keys keep sessions stable across reseeds (`/logout` resets quickly).
- Duplicate button accelerates “version 2” courses and multi-program coverage.
- Email previews now land in `logs/email.log`, so demos don’t rely on external inboxes.
- Audit approvals instantly feed dashboard KPIs—closed loop.

## Phase 1 – Environment & Narrative Setup
1. Mention the hybrid session model (natural keys stored in Flask-Session). Show `/logout` for stale cookies.
2. Run reseed + restart commands; refresh dashboard to prove data loads immediately.
3. Call out new `/logout` GET endpoint for quick resets during walkthroughs.

## Phase 2 – Institution & Program Configuration
1. **Program refresh**  
   - Navigate to Dashboard → Programs.  
   - Edit Biology & Nursing descriptions to reference FA2024 accreditation push.  
   - Refresh to confirm stats cards update. Capture screenshot (`artifacts/program-refresh.png`).
2. **Course versioning + duplication**  
   - In Courses list, use the new **Duplicate** action on `BIOL-201 Cellular Biology`.  
   - Point out the multi-select program picker (attach to Biology + Nursing).  
   - Adjust credit hours to 4 and mention that historical version stays in dashboards.  
   - Show server log snippet proving `POST /api/courses/<id>/duplicate` succeeded.
3. **Course import flow**  
   - Upload `demo_data/course_import_template.xlsx`.  
   - Highlight toast + log entry.  
   - Re-upload to show natural-key idempotence (no duplicate rows). Save toast screenshot + `logs/import_flow.log` excerpt.

## Phase 3 – Faculty & Assessment Execution
1. **Instructor invitation**  
   - Admin → People → Invite `faculty.biology@example.com` to Biology program.  
   - Show toast and reference new preview entry in `logs/email.log`.  
   - `/logout`, sign in as faculty to prove they only see assigned sections (`/api/courses?user_role=instructor`).
2. **Reminders**  
   - Back as admin, open Bulk Emails → Pending Assessments.  
   - Send reminders; screenshot toast, then open `logs/email.log` to show the rendered preview generated by EmailService.  
   - Mention optional CSV export of job status.
3. **Faculty submission**  
   - Faculty navigates to Assessments → `BIOL-201 FA2024`, enters sample scores + narrative.  
   - Upload `demo_data/sample_evidence.pdf`.  
   - Submit; note banner “Submission sent to Biology Program Admin” and confirm `POST /api/assessments/<uuid>/submit` = 200 in logs.  
   - Capture UI screenshot for deck.

## Phase 4 – End-of-Semester Audit
1. **Prereqs** – Ensure Biology has ≥1 submitted, ≥1 pending; Nursing missing evidence (seed already close).  
2. **Audit workflow**  
   - Dashboard → Audit Center, filter Program=Biology, Term=FA2024.  
   - Approve BIOL-201 (note referencing natural key).  
   - Reject Nursing submission citing missing evidence, mention rejection email/log.  
   - Export CSV/PDF summary → save under `demo_artifacts/audit/`.
3. **Dashboard proof**  
   - Assessment Progress panel: capture before/after counts.  
   - CLO Audit widget: highlight natural-key context line.  
   - Data Management panel: show adapter list (ties back to earlier adapter warning fix).

## Appendix – Reset Reminders
- Always reseed + restart before major walkthrough changes.
- Keep `logs/email.log` tailing to quote from during reminders/audits.
- Archive artifacts under `artifacts/` and `demo_artifacts/` as you iterate so the final demo deck has receipts.
