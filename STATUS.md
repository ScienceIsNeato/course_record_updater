## Current Status: Instructor User Stories Complete ✅

**Objective:** Define focused instructor workflow based on CEI meeting insights.

**Key Insight from Meeting:** Leslie's primary need is to "push out the data and pull it back" - coordinate instructor assignments and collect CLO assessment data efficiently.

**Strategic Focus:**
*   **Instructor Management Dashboard:** Program administrator's primary interface for orchestrating instructor workflow
*   **Automated Communication System:** Reduce manual follow-up through targeted notifications and reminders
*   **Streamlined Data Collection:** Exact replica of CEI's current assessment form for familiar instructor experience
*   **Data Import Foundation:** Backfill system with CEI's existing 1,543 CLO records to provide immediate value

**Instructor User Stories Complete:**
*   **11 comprehensive user stories** covering the complete instructor workflow
*   **Key clarifications:** CLO descriptions are pre-populated and managed by program admin
*   **Export formats defined:** Access and PDF formats for personal records
*   **Help system specified:** Direct email links to program admin and technical support
*   **Edit workflow:** Clear process for modifying previously submitted course data

**Next Steps:** 
1. Complete Program Administrator user stories
2. Review and finalize development timeline
3. Package deliverables for CEI stakeholder review

## Current Focus: Milestone 13 - Deployment Setup (Google Cloud Run)

**Objective:** Prepare the application for deployment on Google Cloud Run to allow client access and feedback.

**Tasks:**
*   Create `Dockerfile`.
*   Create `.gcloudignore` file.
*   Configure `gunicorn` for production serving.
*   Guide user through `gcloud run deploy` command.

**Testing Note:** Ensure Firestore credentials/service account setup is handled correctly for the Cloud Run environment.
