# CEI Implementation Milestones & Timeline

**Project:** Instructor Management System for College of Eastern Idaho
**Focus:** Transform Leslie's "push out the data and pull it back" workflow

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Approval

### Milestone 1: User Story Validation
**Objective:** Get CEI stakeholder approval on user requirements
**Deliverables:**
- User story review meeting with Leslie and Dean Taylor
- Incorporate feedback and finalize requirements
- Sign-off on instructor and program admin workflows
- Clarify any remaining questions about CLO hierarchy and reporting

### Milestone 2: Data Import Strategy
**Objective:** Build the bridge between CEI's existing data and our system
**Deliverables:**
- Create script to import from Access database/spreadsheet (1,543 CLO records)
- Map CEI's data structure to our enhanced data model
- Import all existing courses, instructors, and CLO relationships
- Validate data integrity and completeness after import

---

## Phase 2: Core Views & Interface

### Milestone 3: Mock Views Development
**Objective:** Show CEI what the system will look like without full functionality
**Deliverables:**
- Main course sections dashboard with filtering (Year, Term, Instructor, Status)
- Users management view showing instructors and their assignments
- CLO management view for creating and organizing learning outcomes
- Terms/Years management view for academic calendar
- Notifications dashboard for communication management
- Mobile-responsive design demonstration

### Milestone 4: View Approval & Design Refinement
**Objective:** Get CEI approval on interface design before building CRUD operations
**Deliverables:**
- Demo session with Leslie showing all major views
- Gather feedback on layout, filtering, and navigation
- Refine UI/UX based on stakeholder input
- Final approval on visual design and user experience
- **No CRUD functionality yet** - focus purely on views and navigation

---

## Phase 3: Infrastructure & Communication

### Milestone 5: Environment Separation
**Objective:** Establish proper development and production environments
**Deliverables:**
- Set up separate dev and prod environments on Google Cloud Run
- Configure proper database separation (dev/prod Firestore instances)
- Implement deployment pipeline between environments
- Set up monitoring and backup procedures for production

### Milestone 6: Email System Implementation
**Objective:** Build and test the automated communication system
**Deliverables:**
- Email notification system with configurable templates
- Automated reminder scheduling (2 weeks, 1 week, 2 days before term deadline)
- Bulk reminder functionality for incomplete instructors
- Email delivery tracking and status monitoring
- Test with CEI email addresses and institutional mail systems

---

## Phase 4: Pilot Preparation

### Milestone 7: Full CRUD Implementation
**Objective:** Build complete functionality for instructor and admin workflows
**Deliverables:**
- Complete instructor data entry workflow (23 user stories)
- Full program administrator management capabilities (21 user stories)
- Data validation and error handling
- Auto-save functionality and change tracking
- Course section assignment and invitation system

### Milestone 8: Instructor Pilot Launch
**Objective:** First real-world testing with CEI instructors
**Timeline Options:**
- **Option A:** End of current term (final assessments for this term)
- **Option B:** Start of next term (fresh term with new course sections)
**Deliverables:**
- Select pilot group of 5-10 instructors
- Training materials and support documentation
- Real course sections with actual CLO data
- Direct support during initial usage
- Feedback collection and issue tracking

---

## Phase 5: Integration & Refinement

### Milestone 9: Single Course Back-Porting Test
**Objective:** Validate the "pull it back" part of Leslie's workflow
**Deliverables:**
- Export single completed course assessment to Access format
- Test import of exported data into CEI's existing Access system
- Validate data integrity and format compatibility
- Document any field mapping issues or data transformation needs
- Get Leslie's approval on export format and process

### Milestone 10: Database Synchronization Testing
**Objective:** Ensure smooth data flow between systems during transition period
**Deliverables:**
- Test bi-directional data sync between web system and Access
- Handle conflicts and data reconciliation scenarios
- Automated sync scheduling and monitoring
- Rollback procedures in case of sync failures
- Documentation for ongoing database management

---

## Phase 6: Full Production (Future)

### Milestone 11: Institution-Wide Rollout
**Objective:** Expand beyond pilot to all CEI programs
**Scope:** TBD based on pilot success and stakeholder feedback

### Milestone 12: Advanced Reporting & Analytics
**Objective:** Replace CEI's current reporting system
**Scope:** TBD - currently out of scope, CEI has reporting covered

---

## Key Decision Points

### Pilot Timing Decision
**Question:** End of current term vs. start of next term?
**Factors to Consider:**
- Instructor availability and stress levels
- Term deadline pressure
- Training time requirements
- Feedback collection timing

### Data Migration Strategy
**Question:** Big bang migration vs. gradual transition?
**Current Approach:** Parallel systems with export/import bridge
**Benefits:** Risk-free evaluation, maintains existing workflow

### Success Criteria for Each Phase
**Phase 1-2:** Stakeholder approval and data import success
**Phase 3-4:** Successful pilot with positive instructor feedback
**Phase 5:** Seamless data export and Access integration
**Phase 6:** Full adoption and reduced manual workflow for Leslie

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data import complexity:** Start with sample data, validate thoroughly
- **Email delivery issues:** Test with CEI's mail system early
- **Access export compatibility:** Regular testing with Leslie's actual database

### User Adoption Risks
- **Instructor resistance:** Strong training and support during pilot
- **Change management:** Gradual rollout with parallel system option
- **Technical support:** Dedicated support during initial phases

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep:** Focus on core workflow, defer advanced features
- **Timeline pressure:** Build buffer time into each milestone
- **Stakeholder alignment:** Regular check-ins and approval gates

This milestone sequence ensures we build incrementally, get approval at each stage, and maintain the bridge strategy that reduces adoption risk for CEI.
