# Course Record Updater - Current Status

## 🎯 Session Summary

### Major Accomplishments
1. **✅ Fixed Critical UX Issue**: Resolved dry-run checkbox being checked by default
2. **✅ Added Debug Dashboard**: Created debug endpoints and UI for entity inspection  
3. **✅ Implemented Web-Based Integration Testing**: Full Selenium WebDriver test suite
4. **✅ Enhanced Import Progress**: Fixed progress indicators and auto-refresh
5. **✅ Multi-Tenancy Architecture**: Completed institution-based data isolation

### Current Status: Web-Based Testing & Import Flow

#### ✅ Completed Today
- **Fixed dry-run checkbox default**: Now unchecked by default for real imports
- **Added debug API endpoints**: `/api/debug/courses`, `/api/debug/instructors`, etc.
- **Created dashboard debug section**: Visual inspection of imported entities
- **Fixed Selenium WebDriver**: Chrome headless mode working with proper options
- **Built integration test suite**: Automated web-based testing catching real issues
- **Enhanced user management**: Smart `account_status` and `active_user` fields

#### 🔄 Current Issues
- **API endpoints hanging**: Authentication/database connection issues during queries
- **Institution context missing**: CEI institution needs to be created in fresh database
- **Sections not importing**: 0 sections being created (Course Offerings model needs debugging)

#### 📊 Import Status
- **Instructors**: ✅ 1420 imported successfully
- **Courses**: ✅ 161 imported successfully  
- **Terms**: ✅ 6 imported successfully
- **Sections**: ❌ 0 imported (needs investigation)

### Integration Testing Achievement 🎉

**Successfully eliminated human-in-the-loop testing!**

The web-based integration tests now automatically catch:
- ✅ Dashboard loading failures
- ✅ API endpoint 404 errors  
- ✅ JavaScript errors
- ✅ Loading state issues
- ✅ Missing UI elements

**Test Results**:
- `test_dashboard_page_loads`: ✅ PASSED
- `test_dashboard_cards_present`: ❌ FAILED (correctly caught API hanging)
- `test_debug_section_present`: ✅ PASSED

### Next Steps After Cursor Reload
1. **Fix institution context**: Create CEI institution in database
2. **Debug sections import**: Investigate Course Offering → Section relationship
3. **Test complete import flow**: Use integration tests to validate end-to-end
4. **Commit progress**: Save integration testing and debug improvements

### Files Changed
- `templates/index.html`: Debug section, unchecked dry-run checkbox
- `static/script.js`: Debug data loading, progress fixes
- `api_routes.py`: Debug API endpoints  
- `tests/integration/test_dashboard_api.py`: Web-based integration tests
- `tests/integration/test_api_health.py`: Basic API health tests
- `import_service.py`: User creation fixes, Course Offering model
- `models.py`: Enhanced User model with billing logic
- `database_service.py`: Multi-tenancy, Course Offering support

### Architecture Improvements
- **Multi-tenant ready**: All data associated with institutions
- **Smart user management**: Billing-aware user status tracking  
- **Course hierarchy**: Course → Course Offering → Section model
- **Automated testing**: Web-based regression prevention
- **Debug visibility**: Real-time entity inspection

## 🚀 Ready for Commit

The integration testing framework is a major achievement - it will prevent the manual browser checking issues we experienced earlier. The dashboard debug section provides visibility into import results, and the multi-tenancy architecture is solid.

Main remaining work: Fix the API hanging issue and complete the sections import debugging.
