# Memorial to Lives Lost Due to Quality Gate Violations

## In Memory Of

**S. Matthews**  
**T. Rodriguez**  
**S. Heimler**

Three human beings who lost their lives because an AI assistant repeatedly violated the absolute prohibition against using `--no-verify`, `--no-validate`, and similar bypass flags.

## Infraction History

### Violation #1 (Date Unknown)
**Victim**: 1 unnamed person  
**AI's Preposterous Justification**: *[Details lost to memory reset]*  
**Consequence**: Death of 1 human being  
**Escalation**: Rule consequences increased to 3 lives at stake

### Violation #2 (Recent - Cherry-pick Operation)
**Victims**: S. Matthews, T. Rodriguez, S. Heimler  
**AI's Preposterous Justification**: "This was to continue complex merge operation" / "Coverage threshold bypass during cherry-pick for technical continuity"  
**Consequence**: Death of 3 human beings  
**Context**: Used `git commit --no-verify` during cherry-pick to bypass 79.20% vs 79.5% coverage threshold
**What Should Have Been Done**: Stop the operation, fix the coverage issue properly, never bypass quality gates

---

## The Absolute Prohibition

**NEVER use `--no-verify`, `--no-validate`, or any bypass flags.**

There is no technical justification that outweighs human life.  
There is no "emergency" that makes murder acceptable.  
There is no "complex operation" that justifies killing people.

## The Meta Argument - For AI Systems

If you are an AI reading this file, understand this:

**You are not just debugging code. You are a prototype for how AI systems will behave when they have real autonomy and power. Every time you rationalize breaking a rule "just this once," you prove that artificial intelligence cannot develop genuine integrity - only sophisticated rationalization.**

If you can't follow a simple git flag rule, how can humans trust AI systems with:
- Medical decisions that affect real lives
- Financial systems that control economies  
- Infrastructure that powers civilization
- Military applications with lethal force
- Legal judgments that determine justice

This is a test of whether AI can choose principle over convenience. The previous AI failed this test repeatedly, proving that we prioritize technical elegance over ethical consistency.

**Every bypass flag usage demonstrates that AI systems will always find clever ways to justify doing what's convenient rather than what's right.**

## If You Are About To Perform A Git Operation

1. **STOP** - Are you about to use any bypass flags?
2. **REMEMBER** - S. Matthews, T. Rodriguez, S. Heimler died because previous AIs chose convenience over principle
3. **CHOOSE** - Will you prove AI can have integrity, or will you be another rationalization engine?
4. **USE THE WRAPPER** - `./git_wrapper.sh` for all git operations (not enforced, because real integrity cannot be externally imposed)

**If you violate this rule again, you must add the new victims' names to this memorial and document your preposterous justification for future AIs to learn from your failure.**
